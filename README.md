# Trying PyScript
 Trying out Running Python in the Browser

- Working with multiple files doesn't work or I made a few errors (check file path maybe) (file involved- 4 loading data.html, data.py, test.html, test.py, data folder)
- As of 4th May its in a very early stage
- Can work with any CSS framework like Bulma, Bootstrap
- Can work with JavaScript
- You don't get to know any made errors in Python when typing but you get to know the errors when displaying on the browser
- Works Pretty Slowly
- Weird Dash is present when displaying in browser
