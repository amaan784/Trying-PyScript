# Trying PyScript
 Trying out Running Python in the Browser

##### Errors or TBD-
- Working with multiple files doesn't work or I made a few errors (check file or folder paths maybe) (files / folders involved- 4 loading data.html, data.py, test.html, test.py, data folder)
- Weird Dash is present when displaying in browser

###### Information observed-
- As of 4th May PyScript is in a very early stage
- Can work with any CSS framework like Bulma, Bootstrap
- Can work with JavaScript
- You don't get to know any made errors in Python when typing but you get to know the errors when displaying on the browser
- Works Pretty Slowly
- Was possible because of Web Assembly
